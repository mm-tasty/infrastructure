To deploy changes:

1. mtib.dev, a custom set of SSH keys is created and injected via GitHub secrets to allow to scp onto mtib.dev as root
2. laptop.lab.vpn.mm, a custom set of SSH keys is created and injected via GitHub secrets (identical to the one above) to allow access to this machine. However, it is only accessible via the VPN through mtib.dev
